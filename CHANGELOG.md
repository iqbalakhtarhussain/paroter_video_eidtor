## 8.0.0

#### Features
- **Layer Interaction Overhaul**:
  - Replaced the old `enableInteraction` property on layers with the new `LayerInteraction` class, introducing more specific configuration options:
    - `enableMove`, `enableScale`, `enableRotate`, and `enableSelection`.
  - This provides greater flexibility and precision in configuring layer interactions.

- **Customizable Interaction Widgets**:
  - Updated `LayerInteractionWidgets` with two new options:
    - **`children`**: Allows users to define their own interactive button designs when the layer is selected.
    - **`border`**: Enables users to customize the border appearance of selected layers for a fully tailored design.

#### Breaking Changes
- Removed all deprecated values, including:
  - `TextLayerData`
  - `PaintingLayerData`
  - `EmojiLayerData`
  - `StickerLayerData`
  - `ReactiveWidgetData`
  - `ReactiveAppbarData`
  - `serializeSticker`
  - `exportStickers`

## 7.6.5

## 7.6.0
- **FEAT**(state-history): Improve internal state history to consume less RAM during in-app usage, enhancing performance in memory-constrained environments.
- **FEAT**(export/import): Introduce reference-based export mechanism to reduce redundancy and significantly minimize export file size.
- **FEAT**(export/import): Add `enableMinify` option to `ExportEditorConfigs` (enabled by default), which further reduces the output file size by minifying key structures. Even with minification disabled, export sizes are notably smaller due to optimizations.
- **REFACTOR**(tests): Reorganize tests by moving module-specific tests to `features` and `shared` directories for better maintainability.
- **TEST**(export/import): Add unit tests for `key_minifier` to ensure reliability of the minification process.

See pull request [#322](https://github.com/hm21/pro_image_editor/pull/322) for more details.

## 7.5.0

See pull request [#315](https://github.com/hm21/pro_image_editor/pull/315) for more details.

## 7.4.0

The current Flutter version `3.27.1` has an open issue with the `ColorFiltered` widget. As a result, the tune and filter editor will not function in Wasm. Once Flutter resolves this issue, the editor should work without requiring further updates.

## 7.0.1
- **FIX**(zoom): Corrected the layer rotation calculation when the user drags the rotation button. This resolves issue [#266](https://github.com/hm21/pro_image_editor/issues/266)

### Changed
- **File Structure Update**:
  - Moved `custom widgets`, `icons`, and `theme` files into the `configs` directory for better organization.
  - Renamed all `theme` files to `styles` to better reflect their purpose.

### Breaking Changes
- File renaming and restructuring require updates to your configuration file:
  - `custom widgets`, `icons`, and `theme` files are now located directly in the `configs` directory of the editor.
  - All theme classes are renamed to end with `Style` for consistency.
